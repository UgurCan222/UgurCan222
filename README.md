•This research focuses on the problem of missing data in model building and data
analysis processes.It examines the performance of 14 different imputation
methods adapted to address this problem and compares the results obtained with
4 different parameter optimization methods for those that require parameter
optimization. This is an experimental study and the performance of the methods
used may vary from dataset to dataset. The most prominent method for this study
is the XGBoost method.

AWARDS

Vodafone Hackaton

Within 24 hours we were asked to create an app for women, the choice of ideas was
free.Me and my team created an app. This app allows users to easily access practical
and healthy recipes, search for recipes with available ingredients and share
information about nutritional values.


PROJECTS

ugurcreative Studios
Used Technologies: HTML,CSS,Node, JavaScript, React, Angular, ASP.NET Core, Unity,
Android Studio, Vuforia (AR), PyGame, Python
In my own small organization,I developed and published 2 games in the Google Play
Store, a strategy game called Defend Sparta and an arcade game called Jumper Pill
Jump. My games have received more than 20,000 downloads in total.I also created a
blog site called viphukukdanismanlik.com in line with customer demand.I also have
many unpublished projects such as a book sales site and various games.
2021 – 2023

Calculating The Number of People Entering and Exiting From Live Camera Footage
Task giver: Professor Dr. Mehmet Karaköse
A specialized object recognition app has been developed that uses live camera
footage to record the number of people entering and exiting a street camera.It uses
deep learning techniques to accurately detect and count people in real time.
2023

Door Opening With Face Recognition System (TUBITAK Project)
Authors: Uğur CAN, Associate Professor Dr. Ahmet ÇINAR
A security system where the door is opened only when the faces registered in the
database face the live camera. There is no model training, it is enough to take a
webcam photo of the face of the person the system wants to detect and put it in the
folder used by the application.
2023

Custom Object Recognition App, Trained With Own Database
Used Technologies: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, LabelImg
I was the leader of a group of 18 computer engineering students. Each student took
40 photos of an object of their choice and we created a dataset with it, and then we
trained with this dataset and tested it over the webcam.
2022

E-commerce Website with Payment Method
Used Technologies: Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PayPal API, Bootstrap
Developed a comprehensive e-commerce website for a textile business using Django.
The site features a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing textile
products.Integrated PayPal for secure and seamless payment processing.
Implemented functionalities include product catalog management, shopping cart,
order tracking, and user authentication.
